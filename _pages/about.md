I am a PhD candidate at [$${\color{purple}{\texttt{CREST}}}$$](https://crest.science/)/[$${\color{purple}{\texttt{Ecole Polytechnique}}}$$](https://www.polytechnique.edu) under the supervision of Prof. [$${\color{purple}{\texttt{Alessandro Riboni}}}$$](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandroriboni/) since October 2022.

My research lies in the field of geoeconomics and international trade, with a focus on economic sanctions.  

I am currently visiting UC Berkeley, hosted by Cecile Gaubert.
