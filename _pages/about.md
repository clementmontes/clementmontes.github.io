I am a PhD candidate at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en)/[CREST](https://crest.science/) under the supervision of [Prof. Alessandro Riboni](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandroriboni/) since October 2022.

I am interested in political economy, international trade and networks. My research focuses on the effectiveness of economic sanctions targeted at the entity level. In my thesis, I aim at quantifying the impact algorithms have on market outcomes and users, and studying which tools could be given to the latter to have more power in front of platforms.
