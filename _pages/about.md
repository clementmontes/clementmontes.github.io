I am a PhD candidate at [CREST](https://crest.science/)[Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris)](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en)/ under the supervision of [Prof. Alessandro Riboni](https://sites.google.com/site/alessandroriboni/) since October 2022.

I am interested in political economy, international trade and networks. My research focuses on the effectiveness of economic sanctions targeted at the entity level. In my thesis, I aim at quantifying the determinants of the success of an economic sanctions (size of the firm, place in the supply chain), and the mechanisms through which an embargo lower the support to authoritarian governments.
